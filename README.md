# express-angular-es6-starter

An Express + Angular starter upgraded by ES6. Angular is refactored to component style.  

This branch is a scrath of the project, of which the ES6 codes are compiled with traceur. But after a few days I found that babel may be a better solution. So I abandoned the traceur solution, and switch to babel, which the master branch uses.
